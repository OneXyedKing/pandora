    "responses": ["if everyone thinks you're worthless, then maybe you need to find new people to hang out with . seriously , the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in self - esteem . otherwise , you can go round and round trying to understand why you ' re not worthless , then go back to the same crowd and be knocked down again . there are many inspirational messages you can find in social media . maybe read some of the ones which state that no person is worthless , and that everyone has a good purpose to their life . also , since our culture is so saturated with the belief that if someone doesn ' t feel good about themselves that this is somehow terrible . bad feelings are part of living . they are the motivation to remove ourselves from situations and relationships which do us more harm than good . bad feelings do feel terrible . your feeling of worthlessness may be good in the sense of motivating you to find out that you are much better than your feelings today.",

        "hello , and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this . feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common . in fact , most people , if not all , have felt this to some degree at some point in their life . you are not alone . changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it ' s hard to do . our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it ' s place . without your permission , another thought can just pop in there . the new thought may feel worse than the last one ! my guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here . people often try thinking positive thoughts , debating with their thoughts , or simply telling themselves that they need to \" snap out of it \" - which is also a thought that carries some self - criticism . some people try a different approach , and there are counselors out there that can help you with this . the idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts , you change how you respond to them . you learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don ' t have the same impact on you that they do right now .",
        "first thing i ' d suggest is getting the sleep you need or it will impact how you think and feel . i ' d look at finding what is going well in your life and what you can be grateful for . i believe everyone has talents and wants to find their purpose in life . i think you can figure it out with some help .",
        "i first want to let you know that you are not alone in your feelings and there is always someone there to help . you can always change your feelings and change your way of thinking by being open to trying to change . you can always make yourself available to learning new things or volunteering so that you can make a purpose for yourself ."]

    "responses": ["conflict is a tricky beast and shows up in every one of our relationships . what i ' m reading is that you find yourself in a loop of seeking validation of your thoughts and feelings from your friends rather than validating yourself . am i right ? if you aren ' t validating yourself , no one else will be able to either . try finding a small nugget of truth in the feedback your friends give you , this will help to lower your defenses and help your friends hear what you are really sharing . and then if you are still feeling vulnerable , share that too .",
        "it sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner , correct ? communication is key to any relationship . i would recommend speaking with your friends face - to - face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning . in - person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts , emails or any written response can be misconstrued . be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded . if after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling , maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly . especially if this friendship is valuable to you . however , make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them . on the other hand , if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded , it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship . not all friendships are healthy ones . and it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it . i hope you are able to get this matter sorted . best of luck !"]
